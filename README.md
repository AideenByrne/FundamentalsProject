# FundamentalsProject
This repository contains my project submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analytics module, as part of the Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Data Analytics) course at GMIT.

The project document is written as a *Jupyter Notebook* and saved in this repository as **Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project.ipynb.** In order to run the project Notebook it needs to be saved locally as a .ipynb file and accessed from the command line using the command jupyter notebook which will open it in a web browser tab.

The repository also contains some image files in a folder named **img** that have been linked in the project document.
